This is a list of moves that I have changed/added

Currently just playing around with the data, getting an idea of this code. 

# Pokemon Edited

* **_Chikorita_**, **_Totodile_**, & **_Cyndaquil_**

# New moves
#### The correct syntax to read this is **_Name_** | **_Level Learned_**| **_Move Learned_**
